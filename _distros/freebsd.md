# Metadata
title: FreeBSD
description: >
  FreeBSD is a UNIX-like operating system for the i386, amd64, IA-64, arm, MIPS,
  powerpc, ppc64, PC-98 and UltraSPARC platforms based on U.C. Berkeley's
  "4.4BSD-Lite" release, with some "4.4BSD-Lite2" enhancements. It is also based
  indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's "Net/2" to the i386,
  known as "386BSD", though very little of the 386BSD code remains. FreeBSD is
  used by companies, Internet Service Providers, researchers, computer
  professionals, students and home users all over the world in their work,
  education and recreation. FreeBSD comes with over 20,000 packages
  (pre-compiled software that is bundled for easy installation), covering a wide
  range of areas: from server software, databases and web servers, to desktop
  software, games, web browsers and business software - all free and easy to
  install.
