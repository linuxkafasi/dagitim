# Metadata
title: Ubuntu
description: >
  Ubuntu is a complete desktop Linux operating system, freely available with
  both community and professional support. The Ubuntu community is built on the
  ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be available
  free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local
  language and despite any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom
  to customise and alter their software in whatever way they see fit. "Ubuntu"
  is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others". The Ubuntu
  distribution brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.
